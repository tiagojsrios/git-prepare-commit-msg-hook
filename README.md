# git-prepare-commit-msg-hook

A lot of developers identify JIRA issue when they're creating their feature/hotfix branches, however identification on commit messages are also very important. Therefore, after investigating a bit how I could grab JIRA issue number from branch's name and add it into commit's message, in an automated way, I decided to create this small repository in order to help people that also struggle on this.

# How to setup

1. In order to make sure this git hook is copied to all new cloned repositories, you have to do the following:
   * git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git-templates'
      * Tells git where he should look for templates.
   * mkdir -p ~/.git-templates/hooks
      * Create 'hooks' folder, in order to save our hooks
   * cp ./prepare-commit-msg ~/.git-templates/hooks
      * Copy **prepare-commit-msg** template to the newly created folder
   * chmod a+x ~/.git-templates/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
      * Makes sure the hook is executable.

2. To make this also working for cloned repositories, you can run a script created by me.
   * Run the script: *./script.sh path/to/your/repositories/folder*

*Important to refer that, by default, this will only applied to branches that starts either with feature/ or hotfix/. If you want to change this behavior, you can change the BRANCH_TYPES variable in the prepare-commit-msg file*.

# Branch naming convention that I use

This is important to refer, as it might have impact on the regular expressions written on *prepare-commit-msg* file. When I'm creating a branch, I use the following convention: *branch-type/jira-issue_branch-name*, so I use _ (underscore) to separate *jira issue id* from *branch name*.

Examples:
* feature/ABC-1234_This-is-a-test
* hotfix/ABC-1234_This-is-a-test

# Notes

* If you don't set the path to your repositories' folder, it will use your current directory "."
* If you type jira issue id by yourself, don't worry because it won't be repeated on the commit message.
* Feel free to give suggestions by doing pull requests. This is enough for myself, but I believe that it can be improved!
